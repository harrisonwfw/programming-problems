# programming-problems

## Purpose

This Repo will be periodically updated to contain questions the author have encountered in coding interviews. The author will post his solutions, and some thoughts related to these questions.

## Setup

The repo will be divided to different sub-folders with different problems. The code can and needs to be built locally. I may provide a few test cases, but not a comprehensive one, unlike leetcode. 

## Disclaimer

The repo and the problem will not list the provider of the questions.
